See the Roadmap for planned improvements!\n\nFeatures and productivity\n\nMain features:\n\n    Enter keywords to find in the page\n    Create and automate keyword lists in the popup\n    Search query highlighting on any search engine\n    Compact toolbar to view and edit the query\n    Popup and settings menu for configuration\n    Rapid scrolling to matches\n    Keyword scrollbar markers\n    Completely operable by mouse or keyboard\n    Specific websites can be filtered\n\n\nMatching options:\n\n    Case sensitivity\n    Whole words only\n    Word stemming (match all word forms)\n    Diacritics sensitivity (match accents)\n    Regular expression\n\n\nAccessibility\n\nTo turn off visibility for automatic highlighting, simply open the options page at about:addons > [Mark My Search] > [Preferences] and disable both visibility settings. The highlights will be hidden, while the toolbar and scroll markers remain visible, ready to be shown at a moment's notice. This does not apply to manually activated highlighting.\n\nTo turn off automatic highlighting completely, click the extension's icon to open the popup, and disable \"Detect search engines\".\n\nPermission justifications\n\n    Access browser tabs: Highlighting begins when a search happens in a tab.\n    Access your data for all web sites: A scary permission but absolutely necessary to the basic function of the extension, enabling Mark My Search to read the structure of any webpage you visit (when activated) and subsequently insert highlighting. It does not read or interpret any data except to match it with your search keywords, and no data is ever stored.\n    Read and modify bookmarks: Mark My Search checks for 'dynamic bookmarks' (shortcuts to search engines) to identify these searches. It does not modify bookmarks or store any data.","weeklyDownloads":5,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"ator-dev","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/16976426/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/272/272363.png?modified=1660787827","width":1920,"height":1080,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/272/272363.jpg?modified=1660787827","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":300},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/272/272364.png?modified=1660787827","width":1920,"height":1080,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/272/272364.jpg?modified=1660787827","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":300},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/272/272365.png?modified=1660787827","width":1920,"height":1080,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/272/272365.jpg?modified=1660787827","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":300}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.6,"reviewCount":7,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mark-my-search/reviews/","updateDate":1685536244000},{"id":"{e5b6e4ac-ec96-44f5-b257-e4d3c8291b41}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2709/2709017-32.png?modified=78bb3fae","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2709/2709017-64.png?modified=78bb3fae","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2709/2709017-128.png?modified=78bb3fae"},"name":"Linguist - web pages translator","version":"5.0.7","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4135469/linguist_translator-5.0.7.xpi","homepageURL":"https://github.com/translate-tools/linguist","supportURL":"https://github.com/translate-tools/linguist","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/linguist-translator/","description":"Translate web pages, highlighted text, Netflix subtitles, private messages, speak text, and save important translations to your personal dictionary to learn words in 130 languages.","fullDescription":"Translate web pages, highlighted text, Netflix subtitles, private messages, speak text, and save important translations to your personal dictionary to learn words in 130 languages.\n\nEncountering unfamiliar words while reading an online article?

Locking the front door won’t stop the most determined folks from getting inside, especially if you’ve left the back door and windows unlocked and an extra key under the doormat. That’s why we offer multiple types of privacy protection, most of which aren’t offered in most popular browsers by default.\n\nWith the press of a button, you get seamless protection from most 3rd-party trackers while you search and browse, access to tracking protections for emails you receive, and much more. Together these privacy essentials make more privacy your default.\n\nFEATURE HIGHLIGHTS\n\n    Search Privately by Default — DuckDuckGo Private Search comes built-in, so you can easily search the web without being tracked.\n    Escape Website Trackers Before They Load — automatically stop most hidden trackers (3rd-party scripts) from loading, which prevents companies from collecting and using (e.g. sale, ads, etc.) any data from these trackers. Our cutting-edge tracker blocking technology – called 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection – goes well above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default.\n    Automatically Enforce Encryption — force many sites you visit to automatically use an encrypted (HTTPS) connection, which helps shield your data from Wi-Fi snoopers and network onlookers like your Internet provider. Most popular browsers only direct users to encrypted versions of pages in specific circumstances, like when you navigate directly to a page in the address bar. We check our list of upgradable sites for all links you click.\n    Enable Built-in Email Protection — Over 85% of emails sent to Duck Addresses contained trackers that can detect when you’ve opened a message, where you were when you opened it, and what device you were using. Email Protection makes it easy to block most email trackers and hide your existing address when signing up for things online, all without switching email providers.\n    Escape Fingerprinting — help stop companies from creating a unique identifier for you by blocking their attempts to combine specific information about your browser and device settings.\n    Block Tracking Cookies— prevent most 3rd-party cookies from tracking you as you browse from site to site.\n\n\nADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS NOT AVAILABLE ON MOST BROWSERS\n\n    Link Tracking Protection — helps stop companies from gathering your browsing history and other information via personal identifiers embedded in the links you click on.\n    Embedded Social Content Tracking Protection — blocks embedded Facebook content around the web so they can't track you through their videos, posts, and comments found on other sites. You can easily unblock to view them if desired.\n    Google AMP Protection — forces sites to load content directly from publishers instead of using Google-owned links, which are full of creepy trackers.\n    Signal Your Privacy Preference with Global Privacy Control (GPC) — built-into our app, GPC intends to help you express your opt-out rights automatically by telling websites not to sell or share your personal information. Whether it can be used to enforce your legal rights (for example, current or future CCPA, GDPR requirements) depends on the laws in your jurisdiction.\n\n\nNote about our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection following DuckDuckGo ad clicks: Our 3rd-Party Tracker Protection goes above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default, but we’re constantly working to make it more comprehensive. Currently, if an advertiser wants to detect conversions on their own website for our private DuckDuckGo search ads, our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection will not stop bat.bing.com requests from loading on the advertiser’s website following DuckDuckGo ad clicks, but those requests are stopped in all other contexts. This is because DuckDuckGo private search advertising is in partnership with Microsoft. As part of that partnership, viewing ads on DuckDuckGo is anonymous and Microsoft has committed to not profile our users’ ad clicks.\n\nRead more about this and our Tracking Protections at https://help.duckduckgo.com/privacy/web-tracking-protections/\n\nYou don't need to wait to take back your privacy.

This means if just one account is hacked, every account using the same email address could also be at risk.\n\nFirefox Relay helps you protect your real email address — the one most closely tied to your online identity. It lets you generate unique, random aliases you can use to sign up for accounts, apps, or newsletters, and forwards messages to your real address. If you find that an account is sending unwanted email or spam, you can block the alias and it will stop sending email to your inbox. Once you no longer want an account, you can delete the alias.\n\nWant more protection and convenience? With Firefox Relay Premium you can create unlimited aliases and send replies. Additionally, you can create a custom domain for your aliases that’s easier to remember and share. Need an alias for a restaurant reservation? Just say restaurantname@yourdomain.mozmail.com — no need to create the alias beforehand.\n\nPermissions requested by this add-on and their purpose:\n\nAccess to All Websites (<all_urls>): Our add-on requests access to content from any website you visit.
